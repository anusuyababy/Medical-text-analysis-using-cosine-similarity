              "4  Given that JP is an immunocompetent child older than age 2 without craniofacial abnormalities and ear discharge and with a temperature of less than 39 °C, study results support the approach of either immediate antibiotic treatment or initial observation. If his pain and symptoms worsen or do not improve after 48 to 72 hours, the pediatrician should give JP antibiotics. Typically, a pediatrician will choose either amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate antibiotic treatment for AOM if no recent allergies, antibiotic use, or resistance are noted. If JPs symptoms improve in 48 hours, he should follow up with the pediatrician at the next health maintenance visit.4-9\\n\\nIn terms of pain control, study results show that patients with AOM who received acetaminophen or ibuprofen experienced pa...   \n",
