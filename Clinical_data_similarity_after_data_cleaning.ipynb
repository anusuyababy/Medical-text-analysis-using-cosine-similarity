When using rivaroxaban in older adults (those aged 65 and above), it's important to be cautious because they tend to have higher levels of the medication in their system due to slower clearance. Although older patients had more thrombotic (clotting) and bleeding events, the overall effectiveness of rivaroxaban in older individuals is similar to that in younger ones. And importantly, the benefits of using rivaroxaban outweigh the risks in all age groups.   \n",
