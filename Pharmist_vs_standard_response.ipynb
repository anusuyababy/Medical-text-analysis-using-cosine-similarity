In terms of antitussive treatment, it is considered safe for pregnant patients to use dextromethorphan for a dry cough. Although dextromethorphan has a wide margin of safety, it is available OTC as a single ingredient and in combination with active ingredients acetaminophen, antihistamines, decongestants, and guaifenesin. The use of dextromethorphan (antitussive) and guaifenesin (protussive) is counteractive, as each ingredient is working to achieve opposite outcomes. Pregnant patients should avoid decongestants such as pseudoephedrine. Likewise, some antitussive cough syrups are made with alcohol, which should be avoided during pregnancy.

Although the exact mechanism of action and objective efficacy of camphor and menthol are lacking, there are theoretical explanations for how they work. Inhaled camphor and menthol stimulate sensory neurons to create an anesthetic sensation and a feeling of improved respiratory airflow. Likewise, sensitivity to the cough reflex may be suppressed, leading to a decreased cough. Although generally well tolerated, adverse effects include a burning or irritation sensation of the eyes, nose, or skin upon application. The lethal oral dose of camphor and menthol in adults is 4 g/kg.\\n\\nBoth camphor and menthol are available topically and should be applied to the chest and throat. Advise AG to r...  \n",

A product such as diphenhydramine would be appropriate to recommend; a common adverse effect is drowsiness, which could help her sleep through the night.

Instead, advise RN to use a protussive or expectorant agent such as guaifenesin (Mucinex). This agent should not be used for chronic cough associated with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or emphysema.\\nGuaifenesin works by loosening the mucous and makes the viscous and difficult-to-evacuate mucous more productive and therefore easier to expel.

In terms of antitussive treatment, it is considered safe for pregnant patients to use dextromethorphan for a dry cough. Although dextromethorphan has a wide margin of safety, it is available OTC as a single ingredient and in combination with active ingredients acetaminophen, antihistamines, decongestants, and guaifenesin. The use of dextromethorphan (antitussive) and guaifenesin (protussive) is counteractive, as each ingredient is working to achieve opposite outcomes. Pregnant patients should avoid decongestants such as pseudoephedrine. Likewise, some antitussive cough syrups are made with alcohol, which should be avoided during pregnancy.

Although the exact mechanism of action and objective efficacy of camphor and menthol are lacking, there are theoretical explanations for how they work. Inhaled camphor and menthol stimulate sensory neurons to create an anesthetic sensation and a feeling of improved respiratory airflow. Likewise, sensitivity to the cough reflex may be suppressed, leading to a decreased cough. Although generally well tolerated, adverse effects include a burning or irritation sensation of the eyes, nose, or skin upon application. The lethal oral dose of camphor and menthol in adults is 4 g/kg.\\n\\nBoth camphor and menthol are available topically and should be applied to the chest and throat. Advise AG to r...   \n",

Typically, first-line treatment for a dry, nonproductive cough is a first-generation antihistamine. This can be with or without a decongestant for nasal congestion and naproxen for pain or fever. A product such as diphenhydramine would be appropriate to recommend; a common adverse effect is drowsiness, which could help her sleep through the night. Many patients seek a product that is non-sedating; however, second-generation antihistamines lack antitussive properties and should be avoided for managing cough. Dextromethorphan is another option for patients who want to suppress their cough during waking hours. She should be counseled to follow up with her primary care provider (PCP) if her cough wo...   \n",
              "10  A productive cough can be useful in clearing secretions from the respiratory tract. When RN is unable to evacuate the secretions, this can lead to reduced ventilation of the lungs and impair the ability to resist respiratory infections. The drug he tried is an antitussive and would work against the action of expelling the respiratory secretions. Instead, advise RN to use a protussive or expectorant agent such as guaifenesin (Mucinex). This agent should not be used for chronic cough associated with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or emphysema.\\nGuaifenesin works by loosening the mucous and makes the viscous and difficult-to-evacuate mucous more productive and therefore easier to expel. This medication is generally well tolerated and is not associated with many drug intera...   \n",

Nonpharmacologic interventions (eg, increasing hydration, using a humidifier, wearing nasal strips to mechanically open the airways, and/or using a saline nasal spray) are all reasonable and can be used alone, in combination with one another, or in conjunction with pharmacotherapy to help to mitigate symptoms.

              "13                              Zinc is important in maintaining cellular homeostasis and can potentially prevent viral replication in the nasal mucosa. The National Institutes of Healths (NIH) recommended dietary allowance is 11 mg daily for men and 8 mg for nonpregnant women. With the surge of COVID-19 cases in 2020, some have considered using zinc as prophylaxis for the disease. However, a retrospective study of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine with or without zinc showed no differences in outcomes. Because there are limited studies with COVID-19 and the use of zinc, the NIH guidelines recommend against the use of zinc.16 Additionally, excess zinc consumption is associated with long-term adverse effects, such as anemia, ataxia, copper deficiency, leukopenia, myelopathy, and spasticity.   \n",

Most dry coughs are caused by postnasal drip; therefore, he can take a first-generation antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine. For the nasal congestion, he may benefit from the antihistamine but can also use nasal decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine. If he chooses to  use a nasal decongestant, he should monitor his blood glucose closely, as it may raise his blood sugar level. There are specific OTC formulations with less sugar, such as sugar-free syrups. However, these products would not be appropriate for LH because he does not need an expectorant at this time. If he needs cough drops or lozenges for the sore throat, he could consider sugar-free lozenges.   \n",
