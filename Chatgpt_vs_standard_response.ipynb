Typically, a pediatrician will choose either amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate antibiotic treatment for AOM if no recent allergies, antibiotic use, or resistance are noted. If JPs symptoms improve in 48 hours, he should follow up with the pediatrician at the next health maintenance visit.4-9\\n\\nIn terms of pain control, study results show that patients with AOM who received acetaminophen or ibuprofen experienced pa...   \n",

In terms of antitussive treatment, it is considered safe for pregnant patients to use dextromethorphan for a dry cough. Although dextromethorphan has a wide margin of safety, it is available OTC as a single ingredient and in combination with active ingredients acetaminophen, antihistamines, decongestants, and guaifenesin. The use of dextromethorphan (antitussive) and guaifenesin (protussive) is counteractive, as each ingredient is working to achieve opposite outcomes. Pregnant patients should avoid decongestants such as pseudoephedrine. Likewise, some antitussive cough syrups are made with alcohol, which should be avoided during pregnancy.

Although the exact mechanism of action and objective efficacy of camphor and menthol are lacking, there are theoretical explanations for how they work. Inhaled camphor and menthol stimulate sensory neurons to create an anesthetic sensation and a feeling of improved respiratory airflow. Likewise, sensitivity to the cough reflex may be suppressed, leading to a decreased cough. Although generally well tolerated, adverse effects include a burning or irritation sensation of the eyes, nose, or skin upon application. The lethal oral dose of camphor and menthol in adults is 4 g/kg.\\n\\nBoth camphor and menthol are available topically and should be applied to the chest and throat. Advise AG to r...  \n",

A product such as diphenhydramine would be appropriate to recommend; a common adverse effect is drowsiness, which could help her sleep through the night.

Instead, advise RN to use a protussive or expectorant agent such as guaifenesin (Mucinex). This agent should not be used for chronic cough associated with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or emphysema.\\nGuaifenesin works by loosening the mucous and makes the viscous and difficult-to-evacuate mucous more productive and therefore easier to expel.
