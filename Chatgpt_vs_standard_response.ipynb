In terms of antitussive treatment, it is considered safe for pregnant patients to use dextromethorphan for a dry cough. Although dextromethorphan has a wide margin of safety, it is available OTC as a single ingredient and in combination with active ingredients acetaminophen, antihistamines, decongestants, and guaifenesin. The use of dextromethorphan (antitussive) and guaifenesin (protussive) is counteractive, as each ingredient is working to achieve opposite outcomes. Pregnant patients should avoid decongestants such as pseudoephedrine. Likewise, some antitussive cough syrups are made with alcohol, which should be avoided during pregnancy.

Although the exact mechanism of action and objective efficacy of camphor and menthol are lacking, there are theoretical explanations for how they work. Inhaled camphor and menthol stimulate sensory neurons to create an anesthetic sensation and a feeling of improved respiratory airflow. Likewise, sensitivity to the cough reflex may be suppressed, leading to a decreased cough. Although generally well tolerated, adverse effects include a burning or irritation sensation of the eyes, nose, or skin upon application. The lethal oral dose of camphor and menthol in adults is 4 g/kg.\\n\\nBoth camphor and menthol are available topically and should be applied to the chest and throat. Advise AG to r...  \n",

A product such as diphenhydramine would be appropriate to recommend; a common adverse effect is drowsiness, which could help her sleep through the night.

When RN is unable to evacuate the secretions, this can lead to reduced ventilation of the lungs and impair the ability to resist respiratory infections.

Instead, advise RN to use a protussive or expectorant agent such as guaifenesin (Mucinex). This agent should not be used for chronic cough associated with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or emphysema.\\nGuaifenesin works by loosening the mucous and makes the viscous and difficult-to-evacuate mucous more productive and therefore easier to expel.

There are specific OTC formulations with less sugar, such as sugar-free syrups. However, these products would not be appropriate for LH because he does not need an expectorant at this time.

              "26  Acne vulgaris is a common problem in adolescents and in some adults. This bothersome skin condition is thought to result from genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, although the exact cause remains unknown. PatientÂ’s self-identified blackheads represent a type of noninflammatory lesion; papules, pustules, and nodules are inflammatory lesions associated with this condition. The goals of self-care for this often self-limiting condition include reducing the appearance of lesions and minimizing scarring. Topical retinoids are considered the gold standard treatment for moderate to severe acne, although their availability is limited by their prescription-only status.6\\n\\nIn the case of this patient, consider recommending that she use an OTC face wash containing benzoyl peroxide in ...  \n",

For routine supplementation, we agree with the 2010 Institute of Medicine (IOM, now the National Academy of Medicine [NAM]) report suggesting a recommended daily allowance of 600 international units of vitamin D for all reproductive-age women, including during pregnancy and lactation. In a 2011 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee Opinion, ACOG recommended routine supplementation with the dose in a standard prenatal vitamin until more evidence is available to support a different dose.

              "28  Vitamin D is a nutrient your body needs for building and maintaining healthy bones. That's because your body can only absorb calcium, the primary component of bone, when vitamin D is present. Vitamin D also regulates many other cellular functions in your body. Its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties support immune health, muscle function and brain cell activity.\\n\\nVitamin D isn't naturally found in many foods, but you can get it from fortified milk, fortified cereal, and fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel and sardines. Your body also makes vitamin D when direct sunlight converts a chemical in your skin into an active form of the vitamin (calciferol).\\n\\nThe amount of vitamin D your skin makes depends on many factors, including the time of day, season, latitu...  \n",

The dose may be increased to 5 mg/day as needed, based upon reporting of residual symptoms and under physician guidance.\\nLeucovorin (folinic acid) is an alternative to folic acid. Use of daily folic acid or weekly leucovorin supplementation also prevents the increase in the plasma concentration of homocysteine that otherwise occurs as a result of MTX administration.</td>\n",

              "13                              Zinc is important in maintaining cellular homeostasis and can potentially prevent viral replication in the nasal mucosa. The National Institutes of HealthÂ’s (NIH) recommended dietary allowance is 11 mg daily for men and 8 mg for nonpregnant women. With the surge of COVID-19 cases in 2020, some have considered using zinc as prophylaxis for the disease. However, a retrospective study of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine with or without zinc showed no differences in outcomes. Because there are limited studies with COVID-19 and the use of zinc, the NIH guidelines recommend against the use of zinc.16 Additionally, excess zinc consumption is associated with long-term adverse effects, such as anemia, ataxia, copper deficiency, leukopenia, myelopathy, and spasticity.   \n",

Most dry coughs are caused by postnasal drip; therefore, he can take a first-generation antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine. For the nasal congestion, he may benefit from the antihistamine but can also use nasal decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine. If he chooses to  use a nasal decongestant, he should monitor his blood glucose closely, as it may raise his blood sugar level. There are specific OTC formulations with less sugar, such as sugar-free syrups. However, these products would not be appropriate for LH because he does not need an expectorant at this time. If he needs cough drops or lozenges for the sore throat, he could consider sugar-free lozenges.   \n",
